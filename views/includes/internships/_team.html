  <p class="lead fade-in an-beta">We’re a small team by choice. We believe in quality over quantity: keeping things tight and close-knit means we’re all accountable, and ready to jump in when one of us need a hand. We’re looking for people who don’t just put in the hours—we want folks who support, teach, and learn from the designers around them.</p>
